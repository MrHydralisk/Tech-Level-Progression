# Tech Level Progression

![Text](/Mod%20Page/Images/Tech%20Level%20Progression.png)

You have researched all projects for building spaceships, but your colony still stuck in medieval tech level? This mod can help you fix it.

## Mod Contents

Simple mod that changing faction's tech level based on progress in the research tree. After each research, it checks whether the number of finished projects of higher tech level exceeds the threshold (75% by default) for moving to that tech level. 

Setting "Tech Level can become lower" will try to recalculate current level. This might bring Tech Level quite low, if you have a lot of mods with additional research projects, due to a high threshold setting.
Also there is precise settings for each Tech Level.
